    Text: CHASE (player 2 will get 4 moves to run away from player 1. After these
      4, player one then gets 5 moves to chase player 2. Once you're caught you switch!
      Winner is the player who racked up the most moves)

    Text: BOMB (simply, you have a bomb attached to you! The timer is running down,
      but bumping into the other player will put it on them and their timer will
      start! whoever has the bomb when it goes off loses)

    Text: Your session results (wins/draws/total scores) are stored below and wiped
      clean every time you load the game. Now batlle it out!
