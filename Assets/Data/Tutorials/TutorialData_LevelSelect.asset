    Text: Welcome to the level select screen! Here you can choose which level you
      want to play, and how you want to play it!

    Text: There are three tabs at the top. The "Game Maps" are ones packaged with
      the game. The "Custom Maps" are the ones you have created. And the "Imported
      Maps" are ones others have created that you have downloaded (ordered by author
      name).

    Text: Beneath, you have the level select itself. Simply pick a theme on the left,
      and then pick a level within that theme! If you come across a special level,
      click on the INFO button to see what's so different about it..

    Text: In the same section, you can select which way you want to be turning, you
      can select which game mode you wish to play, and you can also opt in to play
      multiplayer with someone sat with you.

    Text: At the bottom you have your stats. More points means more levels unlocked.
      You then have your individual map's best score just above that - which will
      change depending on which turn direction and game mode you have selected. All
      count to the total score!
