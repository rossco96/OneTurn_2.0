    Text: First level! Let me get you started...

    Text: The game is quite simple - navigate your way around the map and achieve
      the objective of your chosen game mode. The twist? You can only move forward
      or turn in ONE direction.

    Text: If you've selected right hand turns, you can only turn to the right and
      not the left... So think ahead and make sure you don't get stuck!

    Text: Default controls are simply to swipe in the direction you wish to move,
      as long as you remember which way you're allowed to turn.

    Text: 'Other controls, to be changed in the options menu, are either: using buttons
      on the screen; or tapping anywhere on the screen to move forward and swiping
      any direction to turn your chosen direction.'

    Text: Anyway enough from me - get out of here and rack up those points!
